On contract complete or cancel, prompt the owner to rate each bid with bid_status
If selected to do later, prompt the BE to send a notification to submit ratings for contract to the owner

When Contract Status is completed or canceled, BE should send a notification to the bid owners where bid_status is accepeted to submit a rating for the contract_owner

We will need a Service for Creating Ratings
We will need to add to the Notification Service for submitting ratings for the contract_owner & bid_owners
